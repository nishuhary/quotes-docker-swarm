## Description

A config array is a way of managing configurations that are based on glob pattern matching of filenames. Each config array contains the information needed to determine the correct configuration for any file based on the filename. 

## Background

In 2019, I submitted an [ESLint RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/9) proposing a new way of configuring ESLint. The goal was to streamline what had become an increasingly complicated configuration process. Over several iterations, this proposal was eventually born.

The basic idea is that all configuration, including overrides, can be represented by a single array where each item in the array is a config object. Config objects appearing later in the array override config objects appearing earlier in the array. You can calculate a config for a given file by traversing all config objects in the array to find the ones that match the filename. Matching is done by specifying glob patterns in `files` and `ignores` properties on each config object. Here's an example:

```js
export default [

    // match all JSON files
    {
        name: "JSON Handler",
        files: ["**/*.json"],
        handler: jsonHandler
    },

    // match only package.json
    {
        name: "package.json Handler",
        files: ["package.json"],
        handler: packageJsonHandler
    }
];
```

In this example, there are two config objects: the first matches all JSON files in all directories and the second matches just `package.json` in the base path directory (all the globs are evaluated as relative to a base path that can be specified). When you retrieve a configuration for `foo.json`, only the first config object matches so `handler` is equal to `jsonHandler`; when you retrieve a configuration for `package.json`, `handler` is equal to `packageJsonHandler` (because both config objects match, the second one wins).

## Installation

You can install the package using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install @humanwhocodes/config-array --save

# or

yarn add @humanwhocodes/config-array
```

## Usage

First, import the `ConfigArray` constructor:

```js
import { ConfigArray } from "@humanwhocodes/config-array";

// or using CommonJS

const { ConfigArray } = require("@humanwhocodes/config-array");
```

When you create a new instance of `ConfigArray`, you must pass in two arguments: an array of configs and an options object. The array of configs is most likely read in from a configuration file, so here's a typical example:

```js
const configFilename = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "my.config.js");
const { default: rawConfigs } = await import(configFilename);
const configs = new ConfigArray(rawConfigs, {
    
    // the path to match filenames from
    basePath: process.cwd(),

    // additional items in each config
    schema: mySchema
});
```

This example reads in an object or array from `my.config.js` and passes it into the `ConfigArray` constructor as the first argument. The second argument is an object specifying the `basePath` (the directoy in which `my.config.js` is found) and a `schema` to define the additional properties of a config object beyond `files`, `ignores`, and `name`.

### Specifying a Schema

The `schema` option is required for you to use additional properties in config objects. The schema is object that follows the format of an [`ObjectSchema`](https://npmjs.com/package/@humanwhocodes/object-schema). The schema specifies both validation and merge rules that the `ConfigArray` instance needs to combine configs when there are multiple matches. Here's an example:

```js
const configFilename = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "my.config.js");
const { default: rawConfigs } = await import(configFilename);

const mySchema = {

    // define the handler key in configs
    handler: {
        required: true,
        merge(a, b) {
            if (!b) return a;
            if (!a) return b;
        },
        validate(value) {
            if (typeof value !== "function") {
                throw new TypeError("Function expected.");
            }
        }
    }
};

const configs = new ConfigArray(rawConfigs, {
    
    // the path to match filenames from
    basePath: process.cwd(),

    // additional items in each config
    schema: mySchema
});
```

### Config Arrays

Config arrays can be multidimensional, so it's possible for a config array to contain another config array, such as:

```js
export default [
    
    /
